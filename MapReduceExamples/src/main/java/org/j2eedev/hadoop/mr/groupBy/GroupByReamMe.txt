        ./hadoop namenode -format

Step 2: start the hadoop Enivoronment
        ./start-all.sh

Step 3: Make sure the following nodes are started - NameNode, DataNode,TaskTracker, JobTracker

Step 4: create a input folder in hdfs
        ./hadoop dfs -mkdir /tmp/hadoop-gtanniru1/query_in

Step 5:  load the logfile to be analysed into the hdfs   
       ./hadoop dfs -copyFromLocal /home/userid/localfolder/items_log.txt /tmp/hadoop-folder/query-in
        
    Here items_log.txt has the log data to be analysed and query-in is the input folder in hdfs
Step 6: Place the DbHadoop.jar(The Actual Program) file in your hadoop installation directory

Step 7: Run the below command from the bin folder
        ./hadoop  jar ../DbHadoop.jar GroupBy /tmp/hadoop-folder/query-in /tmp/hadoop-folder/query-out 1 1

                   GroupBy is the class with 4 command line parameters 
           1.input hadoop folder 2 .output hadoop folder 3.number of Mappers 4. Number of Reducers
     
 Step 8: After successful execution the results will be store in the hdfs output folder query-out
         in order to list the files, below is the command
        ./hadoop dfs -ls /tmp/hadoop-gtanniru1/query-out
 
Step 9: To copy the files into local file system
        ./hadoop dfs -copyToLocal /tmp/hadoop-folder/query-out/* /home/userfolder/output
